This is a script that reviews files in a folder that have been modified after a certain date.
If a file has been modified after the date, the script copies the file to the destination folder, which is the backup folder. 
If a file with the same name exists in the backup folder, the file is overwritten. This ensures that in the backup folder only the latest version of the file is present.
The script compiles a log file, in a TXT, which lists each file processed, the path of the original file, the path to the backed-up file and a message saying if the
backup was made or there was an error.
